The use of environment contacts enables manipulation strategies that are otherwise impossible with a parallel jaw gripper. We propose to generalize one extrinsic manipulation trajectory to diverse objects and environments by retargeting contact requirements. Using a 7+1 DoF robotic arm-gripper system, we achieved an overall success rate of 80.5% on hardware over 4 long-horizon extrinsic manipulation tasks.
