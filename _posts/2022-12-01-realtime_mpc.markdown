We present a method for continuous improvement of modeling and control after deploying the robot to a dynamically-changing target environment. We develop a differentiable physics simulation framework that simultaneously performs online system identification and optimal control using the incoming observations from the target environment in real time. Our method outperforms baseline methods on simulation and hardware experiments.
