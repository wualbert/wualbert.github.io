Given a list of polytopes and a distance metric in Euclidean space, we seek an empirically fast algorithm to find the nearest polytope to a query point. 
We discuss the properties of 3 proposed algorithms and compare their performances using datasets motivated by control applications, including sampling-based motion planning and model predictive control.
